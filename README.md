## Getting Started
First, install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Click on **List Devices** which will call the generated SNI code from `sni.proto`. A CORS error will return when trying to fetch `localhost:8190`.
